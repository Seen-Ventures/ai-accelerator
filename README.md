# AI Talent Accelerator

Kia ora! This GitHub repo is your one-stop shop for all things technical from the AI Talent Accelerator course. We'll dive deep into generative AI, learn heaps of cool tools, and build some awesome projects.

## What's this course all about?

This 12-week programme is all about getting you up to speed with generative AI. Think hands-on projects, real-world problem-solving, and working with some sweet AI tools. You'll learn how to build AI solutions that are not just clever, but also ethical and inclusive.

## Course Structure

This intensive course blends directed learning (lectures, workshops) with self-directed learning (research, project work). Each week tackles a different theme, from problem definition and user research to building and presenting your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**Here's a quick rundown of the weekly modules:**

- **Week 1: Introduction to AI & Problem Definition:** Get to grips with AI and its impact, learn about responsible AI design, and define the challenge you'll be tackling.
- **Week 2: Research & Stakeholder Engagement:** Dive deep into your challenge through research and talking to stakeholders (users, organisations).
- **Week 3: Ideation & Solution Design:** Brainstorm and design potential AI solutions.
- **Week 4: Prototyping AI Solutions:** Build quick prototypes to test your ideas.
- **Week 5: User Testing & Iteration:** Get feedback from real users and refine your prototypes.
- **Week 6: Preparing for MVP Development:** Plan your MVP and get ready to build!
- **Weeks 7-9: MVP Development & Testing:** Build, test, and refine your MVP.
- **Week 10: Preparing the MVP Presentation:** Learn how to present your awesome work.
- **Week 11: Final MVP Presentations:** Show off your MVP to sponsors and industry experts.
- **Week 12: Career Development & Next Steps:** Get ready for a career in AI and plan your next move.
